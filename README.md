# 📂 CleanDirectory-Automation
An automated Python utility that periodically scans directories, removes empty files, and generates detailed log reports.

---

## 📌 Overview

Directory Sentinel is a Python automation tool that continuously monitors a specified directory at regular intervals.

The application scans every file inside the directory and its subdirectories, identifies empty files, deletes them automatically, and creates a timestamped log file containing the scan details.

This project demonstrates practical usage of:

- File System Automation
- Directory Traversal
- Task Scheduling
- Logging
- Command Line Arguments
- Python Standard Library

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Recursive directory scanning

✅ Detects empty (0-byte) files

✅ Deletes empty files automatically

✅ Generates timestamp-based log files

✅ Displays total scanned files

✅ Displays number of deleted files

✅ Runs automatically every 5 seconds

✅ Supports command-line execution
